-- 0207 — erase_subject_data revokes the subject's outstanding libreta shares.
--
-- WHAT WAS OPEN. `erase_subject_data` (0205) soft-deletes the subject's owned
-- pets and never touches `libreta_share_tokens`: zero statements over that
-- table in any prior definition (grep 0205 for 'libreta' — zero hits). A
-- libreta share is an unauthenticated URL serving the pet's full Tier-2
-- medical history, it can be non-expiring (create-libreta-share.ts:59), and
-- after the erasure every revocation surface 404s on the pet — the guards
-- funnel through resolvePetHolderAccess, which now answers kind:'none' for an
-- erased pet. Net effect: the art. 16 erasure closed the last legitimate way
-- to STOP an ongoing data flow it should itself have stopped.
--
-- TWO HALVES, one here. The reader-side half (the share page filters
-- pets.deleted_at and 404s) ships in the same change, code-only. This
-- migration is the data-side half: the erasure itself revokes the outstanding
-- shares, exactly the way it already cancels the subject's pending transfers
-- and rejects/cancels their pending caretaker grants — a status flip on a
-- workflow row, no event owed to the spine (there is no share_created event;
-- `lib/infra/end-pet-ownerships.ts` states the rule for workflow state).
--
-- The function below is 0205's definition verbatim plus:
--   · DECLARE `libreta_shares_revoked`;
--   · the revocation statement (after the pet_transfers scrub);
--   · the audit_log payload key `libreta_shares_revoked`.
--
-- PART B backfills environments where erasures already ran under the older
-- definitions.

--   · a share on a soft-deleted pet was left behind by a pre-0207 erasure;

--     outstanding grant, whether or not the pet it points at was theirs.
-- revoked_by_user_id stays NULL — there is no actor in a backfill, and the
-- column is nullable by design (ON DELETE SET NULL).
